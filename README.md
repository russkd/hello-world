# hello-world
Starting repository to learn GitHub.
At this point on 3/8/15 I have a few days left teaching, a ton to learn, and I need more clarity of where exactly I wish to take this adventure. 
While I know HTML and CSS okay, my Javascript is still very weak. I have some experience with JQuery and Bootstrap also, but I need to know Javascript well. I also want to learn object-oriented programming. The GA WDI course I am taking will allow me to add Node.js and Ruby.
Of course this is on top of my experience in project management, software development, small business, and research.
